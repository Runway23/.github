## careers
Currently, we have no open positions at Runway23, but if you think you're worth the shot, check out our [Careers](https://r23.xyz/careers) page.

It is important to note that we do not specifically hire anyone and employ them, but rather recruit them as [fellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow#Industry_and_corporate_fellows). They're volunteers with stipends to aid and cover all necessary expenses they might have, and they are free to work on any projects that we have or create their own with our corporate support.
