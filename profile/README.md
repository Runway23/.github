Hey! We're Runway23, a limited-profit cooperative headquartered in Mexico City focused in creating, developing and incubating free and open source software for all.

Here is where most of our development takes place and where we host most of our source code.

## careers
Currently, we have no open positions at Runway23. But you can visit our [Carrers] page for more information about possible recruitment opportunities.

It is important to note that we do not specifically hire anyone and employ them, but rather recruit them as [fellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow#Industry_and_corporate_fellows). They're volunteers with stipends to aid and cover all necessary expenses they might have, and they are free to work on any projects that we have or create their own with our corporate support.
